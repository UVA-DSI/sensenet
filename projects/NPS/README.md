# Networked Public Spaces (NPS) project

"Network Public Spaces" is a collaborative project involving the School
of Data Science and the School of Architecture at UVA for the study and
implementation of community-based environmental sensor networks.

In this repository you will find the design files and source code for the
development board we are designing for low-energy LoRa applications.

## Development board
